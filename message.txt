Hey, dad! I made this because I wanted to tell you how much I love you. Life may not be perfect and there may be quite a bit of issues popping up, but I know we'll get through them as long as we stick together and keep the faith. You are a wonderful person and I am proud to be called your son, I know I don't say it alot, but I hope you'll always know it, even if it goes unsaid. I hope you have a wonderful Father's Day! --- //Nash//
